# My Biggest Research Interest Areas

- Mathematics &rarr; Graph Theory
- Sustainability & the Environment

Below, I will cover the area of graph theory as I have been spending a significant amount of time researching this area as it has piqued my interest the most. 

## Graph Theory

Graphs are considered as one of the best modeling tools to be used when modeling all kinds of relationships and data sets. Many real world problems can be modeled using graphs in various different ways. This is because, at its core, all graph theory is looking at is pairwise relations and connections between objects. It is a fancy way of taking two random objects and examining what connects them, what makes them similar, what makes them different, how they influence each other, and how one object may lead to the other. In a more technical sense, graphs can be used to solve problems of connectivity, cuts, paths, flows, coloring, and graph drawing. Each of these problems has the potential to arrive in the field of computer science, but before getting into that, it is important to lay out what a graph is and how it can be used.

### Graphs

Graphs are simply just a way to visualize mathematical objects and they are made up of two parts mainly:

1. Vertices
2. Edges

Because graphs are so abstract, many different kinds of restrictions can be set on both the edges and vertices to change the situation. Things like directed and undirected edges, as well as limitations on the number of edges and kinds of edges are just some of the possible restrictions. Even with all of these potential changes, they are still mathematically sound and valid. Because of this, graphs become a very flexible tool that allow for all kinds of problems solving. Some features they offer are:

- High level abstractions
- Relationships
- Modeling
- Structure
- Modifiability
- Axiomatic

### Applications

Some of the potential applications include:

- Data base designing
- Software engineering
- Networking
- Hardware
- Data structures
- Image processing
- Data mining
- Operating systems
- Web development

### Why Graph Theory?

Graph theory is a prime candidate to use for all of the above applications for many reasons, but the big ones are as follows: graphs are abstract and flexible modeling tools they carry with them the property of being axiomatic, as well as also bringing many algorithms to the table. All of this combined makes them one of the best mathematical tools to, not only visualize, but also prove and experiment with many different research questions and ideas related to all kinds of algorithms and properties in computer science.
