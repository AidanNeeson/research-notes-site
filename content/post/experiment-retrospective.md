# Notes About My Project

In my conversation with a peer, a few things were brought up that I could have done to make my experiment and prototype better. One of these was creating more methods that interacted with my tableau data structure. The reasoning behind this was to enable me to test out the functionality of my data structure in a more diverse way, as well as to also give me insights on how to move forward. Another was to potentially use a different data structure entirely. Investigating this was already in my plans, but it is worth reiterating, as these structures can become very large, and storing them as lists of lists will be inefficient when the tableau get huge. These were the main points that were brought up in discussion about my prototype. As for my experiment, it was said that more than just random number generation could have been explored. It seemed obvious from the start that it was not going to be viable, so it was brought into question if it was even worth exploring in the first place. From this, I gathered that it is important to take a step back and consider the experiment's meaning, while also striving to do more as well, since it is all about discovery.
