# Feasability Thought Experiment

All aspects of my project are feasable. Conversations with peers have confirmed this. All the way from my skills, to the resources needed to complete the project. However, one issue did arise, that being the improvements itself. I have a lot of ambitions when it comes to the experiments that I want to perform. It is still unclear how many of the improvements I will be able to work out, as the code base and math behind it is very complicated. Therefore, it was hard to estimate the exact feasability.
