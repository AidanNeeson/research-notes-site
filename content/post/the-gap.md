 There is a large knowledge gap that pertains to my research area. This is caused by the entirety of the research area being seated in the unknown. There is a lot of complex math to uncover, as well as various different pathways that can be taken to improve upon previous results, and much of it is undiscovered. In terms of the math, there are only a handful of papers out there that cover my research topic. When it comes to the algorithm, I believe there is only one python algorithm that is out there that can be used to examine my research topic. Because of this, the gap is very large. It will be difficult to get the math background, as well as gian insights on how to create a better algorithm. The goal is to understand both the math behind my research area, as well as how to move forward to ensure that more results can be found. I plan to ensure that this is the case by reading and practicing. I want to explore the math behind it by reading the previous papers that cover the topic. I also want to look into how algorithms can be improved generally, and then apply those principles to the algorithm that was already discovered.
