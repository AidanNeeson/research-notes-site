# A Little About Me

My name is Aidan Neeson and I am currently enrolled as a student at Allegheny College. I am a junior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Energy and Society, as well as Mathematics. I have had a love for computers and the field of computer science ever since I was a kid experimenting with the family computer. Being able to explore this interest of mine in college has been a dream come true and I am learning more than ever. Because of this, I decided it was a good idea to create a website to house all of my research notes to ensure I stay organized.
