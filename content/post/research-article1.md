# [On the Application of Graph Theory to Data Structures](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-4606-7_44) 

This article, as the title of this post suggests, talks about the application of the mathematical field of graph theory to the specific topic of data structures in computer science. It looks at how these two fields can be connected and what it is exactly that brings them together. Once this connection is realized, an in depth analysis of many aspects of data structures are shaped and tested as graph theory problems to find relations, create comparisons, model data structures, and even find things like minimum cost trees. All of these can be used to minimize data retrieval times, minimize page swapping, and overall increase efficiency in many areas. All of this is done simply by abstracting what we know as data structures in computer science, and reforming them into graphs and adjacency matrices to allow us to perform all kinds of mathematical operations, logical operations, and apply proofs and axioms to guide us towards better organization and greater efficiency.

## Relating to My Work

This article has shown me that the possibilities between these two disciplines are endless, even within the scope of just one application. There is so much to explore here, and all of it is interesting in its own way. I am going to have to spend a lot of time reading to narrow down exactly how I want to move forward in this field. Overall, this article is not only supplying me with valuable information about graph theory and its connections to computer science, but it is showing me that it is possible to create a meaningful project out of it as well.
